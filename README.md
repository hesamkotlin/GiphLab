Architecture
The project is implemented with MVVM and it's written fully with Kotlin. 

DI
I used hilt because of fewer boilerplate codes. 

Coroutine
For the threading and observing, I could use technologies like Livedata.In this moment that i typed this line i got some help from some friends to use coroutine(4.4.2022)


UX
I kept UI minimal and tried to just show I know how to use things like constraintlayout, etc, but I guess from the user side it's not good at all :)
